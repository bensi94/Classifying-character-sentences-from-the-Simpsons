## About the project 

The goal of the project was to apply theoretic knowledge about supervised
learning algorithms and the workflow of solving a supervised learning problem
in practice. Using a realistic dataset and design a process of preprocessing the data,
selecting a model and its hyperparameters and impliment a program that automates the process.

## The Dataset

The dataset is called *The Simpsons by the Data* and contains in four csv files list of all Simponsons episodes, Characters, Locations and most importantly a file that contains all spoken text during each episode (including details about which character said it and where). 
  
 The Dataset is from William Cukierski at [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski) and is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data)

### Run the code locally 

Open the file Classifying-character-sentences-from-the-Simpsons.ipynb in jupyter notebook environment. Go to Kernel in the drop down menu, and press Restart and run all.

Running all the code should take from 3 - 7 hours on most computers.
